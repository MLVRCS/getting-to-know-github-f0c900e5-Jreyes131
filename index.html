<p> Athletes know: Top performance requires more than perfect conditions and luck. Relentless training to become stronger and faster. Questioning everything, especially yourself. Learning from every mistake. Because the biggest challenge is to remain unbeatable. With this attitude, Porsche keeps pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Experience the new 911 GT3 RS in top form — with increased race track performance.."</p>

<p>The acceleration from the V10, 600hp engine is truly something to behold. It’s a mix of being on the front row of a high-speed roller coaster and straddling a guided missile.
